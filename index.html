              The objective of this software is to give companies a practical
              tool to measure and improve their internal integration, i.e.: the
              integration between internal departments. It was developed through
              an academic Project coordinated by Prof. Phd Marcio Lopes Pimenta
              and Profa. Phd. Ana Cristina Ferreira, at Federal University of
              Uberlândia. This project had the aim of developing a model to
              predict the antecedents of the integration level of marketing,
              logistics and production, considering the influence of formal and
              informal factors that generate integration and the existence of
              conflicts.

              A survey of 179 participants from all regions of Brazil was
              conducted. A parsimonious model including four dimensions and 34
              variables was developed through confirmatory factor analysis and
              structural equation modeling.

            <p>
              The field data corroborate studies dealing with the impact of
              various formal and informal integration factors on the
              cross-functional integration level as a construct. Furthermore,
              this paper concludes that the level of cross-functional
              integration can be defined as: the intensity of the relationship
              among internal functions which can be measured by the mutual
              existence of formal and informal factors and the absence of
              manifest conflicts.

            How do the theoretical findings support the practical nature of this
            software?

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Cross-functional integration can reduce conflicts between
              employees. Therefore, the higher the level of cross-functional
              integration, the lower the employee distress. Thus, this model
              helps to manage the quality and the intensity of integration
              through an instrument that facilitates the understanding and
              management of this phenomenon. The proposed model has generated
              important information for managers by pointing out variables that
              can predict the integration level and their impacts on the
              organizational performance. The full research paper concludes with
              examples about how the model could be useful in several practical
              situations. It is available in the following link:
